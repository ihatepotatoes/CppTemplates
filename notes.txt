Here I will describe all the new things I found out about templates.

Started to read C++ Templates: The Complete Guide, Part III Templates and
Design.

Read the comparison between static and dynamic polymorphism in C++. Learnt
their strong and weak sides. Found out that there is special patterns for
static polymorphism with templates.

Started to read Chapter 19 Implementing Traits.

Implemented traits for function `accum` from examples #1-3 (omitted #4).
Placed them in ./traits/.

Implemented traits and policies for function accum from the rest of examples.
Learnt new terms Trait and Policy. Traits consist of properties and special
values, policies regulate behavior.

Started to read Chapter 19.3 Type Functions.

Value function - function that takes some values as arguments and return
another value as a result. Type function - function template that takes some
types as template arguments and produce a type or a constant as a result.

Learnt transformation, predicate and (almost) SFINAE-based traits.

Brief repeating of Chapter 19 Implementing Traits. Read about SFINAE-based
traits. Read about templates instantiation details and name resolving in C++.

Instruction pointer: Chapter 19.4.4 SFINAE-Friendly Traits.
