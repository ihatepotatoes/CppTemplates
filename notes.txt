Started to read Chapter 19 Implementing Traits.

Implemented traits for function `accum` from examples #1-3 (omitted #4).

Started to read Chapter 19.3 Type Functions.

Value function - function that takes some values as arguments and return
another value as a result. Type function - function template that takes some
types as template arguments and produce a type or a constant as a result.

Learnt transformation, predicate and (almost) SFINAE-based traits.

Instruction pointer: Chapter 19.4 due to necessity of repeat.
